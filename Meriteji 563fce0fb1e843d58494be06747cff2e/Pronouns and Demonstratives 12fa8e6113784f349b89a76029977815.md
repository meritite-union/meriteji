# Personal Pronouns

<aside>
<img src="https://www.notion.so/icons/info-alternate_green.svg" alt="https://www.notion.so/icons/info-alternate_green.svg" width="40px" /> ‘Personal’ in Meriteji is meant more literally than grammatically. They must be used with animate, personal, nouns. They cannot be used to describe non-sentient objects. The bar for sentience is low, however use of pronouns has an implication of personification.

</aside>

Personal pronouns in Meriteji are irregular nouns that decline to number, person, and case. 

**Singular** will always refer to one person only.

**Paucal** and **Plural** forms are relative to each other; no set number of people is defined as paucal or plural, it is relative. A paucal pronoun can refer to 50 or even more people relative to a larger group.

The **1st Person** is any combination of people that includes the speaker. In the singular forms, this is the speaker themself.

The **2nd Person** refers to any combination of people that includes the listener(s). 

The **3rd Person** has primary and secondary forms and refers to anyone who is not in the conversation. The primary and secondary forms can be used to keep track of two different groups of people. This is usually called the **4th Person** in Meriteji’s description.

## Demonstratives

Demonstratives are the equivalent to ‘this’, ‘that’, ‘here’, ‘there‘ words. They come in two forms, Objective and Locative, and 3 distances, proximal, medial, and distal. Like the personal pronouns, there is a fourth form. This form is not attatched to the distal, and can be used to relate a fourth subject, regardless of its relative locations. It can only be used when the needed slot is filled; if a proximal has been used and must continue to be tracked, then the fourth form can take this place. All forms, declined, are shown below:

|  | Proximal Obj | Proximal Loc | Medial Obj | Medial Loc | Distal Obj | Distal Loc | Fourth Obj | Fourth Loc |
