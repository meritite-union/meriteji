There are many dialects and variations in pronunciation and vocabulary. One major branch is the Western dialect. Its characteristic feature is “rhoticity”, a term taken from English to describe the language’s r sounds. In rhotic accents, like Western, the r approximate and approximate coda is realized as /ɹ/.
