# Verbs

Verbs in Meriteji are mostly agglutinative with a very clearly designed set of endings based on mood, tense, and aspect, in that order, plus a few extra non-finite constructions. Verbs have no association with their subject, and as such do not conjugate by number or person. All verbs fall into four categories, marked by the glide at the end of their infinitive, and are named:

> **-ye***,* **-we***,* **-re***,* and **-le.**
> 

Each one suggests something about how the verb works:

- -ye verbs are always transitive.
- -we verbs are always intransitive.
- -re verbs are always both transitive and intransitive.
- -le verbs have no association and can be any of the above.

Each mood, tense, and aspect has an associated ending for each verb type, however due to sound assimilation and other phonetic rules, each specific combination has some variation, and so it is more practical to present each combination rather than individual rules.

There are 4 moods:

- **Indicative**:
    - This is the most common mood. It is used for statements as facts and general ideas. It can be used independently of other verbs.
- **Inferential**:
    - This mood is used when information is not directly recieved, and at least some kind of interpretation or assumption is implied. It can also be used inside of
- **Subjunctive**:
    - The subjunctive is used for wishes, desires, hypotheticals, opinions. It must be paired with an indicative or inferential verb in some capacity to specify the manner of subjunctivity.
- **Imperative**:
    - This is used for direct commands or calls for action. Unlike all other moods, the imperative does not have tense or aspect. It follows different rules and behaves more like a non-finite construction than a conjugated verb.

> The tenses are **past**, **present**, and **future**.
> 

There are 3 aspects:

- **Perfective** (sometimes, incorrectly, called Perfect):
    - This aspect refers to simple events that occur as a whole, or implying completion. There is no emphasis placed on the progression of an event, or the repeated or habitual nature of an action. Aspect is fully optional—defaulting to perfective—an action could be expanded to habitual or progressive states, but the speaker can, in many cases, choose not to explicitly specify.
- **Habitual**:
    - The habitual aspect implies that an event occurs, occurred, or will occur on more than one occasion.
- **Progressive**:
    - The progressive aspect places emphasis to the duration, progression, and continuation of an action.

Once the mood is chosen, each movement from the center (Present Perfective) adds another ending or complication. This makes the Present Perfective the default tense and aspect.

# Conjugation

**All** conjugations and constructions are formed by tacking endings to the stem. The stem is formed from the infinitive, minus the glide and vowel e, leaving the beginning of the verb plus the onset consonant in the final syllable. If this consonant is null, then *t-* must be added. These verbs are known as t-stem verbs. 

## Indicative

| Tense | Aspect | -ye | -we | -re | -le |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Past | Habitual | -inde | -unde | -rinde | -linde |
| Past | Perfective | -o | -o | -o | -o |
| Past | Progressive | -ïn | -ün | -rinnï | -linnï |
| Present | Habitual | -ide | -ude | -ride | -lide |
| Present | Perfective | -i | -u | -ri | -li |
| Present | Progressive | -ï | -ü | -ritï | -litï |
| Future | Habitual | -ibade | -ubade | -ribade | -libade |
| Future | Perfective | -iba | -uba | -riba | -liba |
| Future | Progressive | -ibä | -ubä | -ribä | -libä |

## Inferential

All verb types use the same endings.

| Tense | Aspect | Ending |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Past | Habitual | -ende |
| Past | Perfective | -en |
| Past | Progressive | -ë |
| Present | Habitual | -ede |
| Present | Perfective | -e |
| Present | Progressive | -ë |
| Future | Habitual | -ebade |
| Future | Perfective | -eba |
| Future | Progressive | -ebä |

## Subjunctive

| Tense | Aspect | -ye | -we | -re | -le |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Past | Habitual | -yonde | -waunde | -reinde | -lainde |
| Past | Perfective | -yon | -waun | -rein | -lain |
| Past | Progressive | -yonnë | -waunnä | -reinnë | -lainnä |
| Present | Habitual | -yode | -waude | -reide | -laide |
| Present | Perfective | -yo | -wau | -rei | -lai |
| Present | Progressive | -yotë | -wautä | -reitë | -laitë |
| Future | Habitual | -yobade | -waubade | -reibade | -laibade |
| Future | Perfective | -yoba | -wauba | -reiba | -laiba |
| Future | Progressive | -yobä | -waubä | -reibä | -laibä |

## Imperative

The imperative has syllabic and non-syllabic variants in free variation. All verb types use the same endings.

| Variation | Onset (no t-stem) | Non-onset (t-stem) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Syllabic | -oko | -ko |
| Non-syllabic | -ok | -k |

# Using Non-Finite Forms

In addition to the finite forms, which restrict a verb to a tense, aspect, and mood, non-finite forms are additional derivations from base verbs to produce more meaning. These include:

> the **infinitive**, **active**, **passive**, and **intransitive participles**, and **sequential**, **exhaustive**, ****and **illustrative coordinates**.
> 

## Infinitive

The **Infinitive**, in addition to being the base, unmarked form of a verb, also acts as the main nominal form for verbs. It can be used anywhere a noun is taken as complement, including subjects. Infinitive forms are D5, and do not decline.

## Participles

Participles are universal atnate adjective forms of verbs. They are divided into three forms, and different verb types use one, two, or all forms depending on their transivity.

### Active participle

The active participle denotes describing a noun as performing a verb without using it in a clause. It describes the agent. For example, “The frustrating homework” and “The homework that frustrates me” are the same thing, but non-finite, meaning a lack of person, tense, mood, etc.

-we verbs and some -le verbs which are always intransitive do not have an active participle form. As such, all active participles are formed with the ending -ingi.

| Verb | -ye | -we | -re | -le |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Ending | -ingi | **-N/A-** | -ringi | -lingi |

### Passive participle

The passive participle denotes the opposite—a noun that recieves an action or is made to be something. It shares its English translation often with the Intransitive participle: the speaker must make a nuanced decision whether the noun is self-inflicted or specifically caused by another agent.

Again, -we verbs and some -le verbs which are always intransitive do not have an passive participle form. As such, all passive participles are formed with the ending -ishi.

| Verb | -ye | -we | -re | -le |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Ending | -ishi | **-N/A-** | -rishi | -lishi |

### Intransitive participle

Intransitive participles apply for describing a noun with a verb that it takes on intransitively. This is standard for intransitive verbs, but for verbs with intransitive/transitive verb pairs, or for -re verbs and some -le verbs, leaving all three participles open for use can allow for some added nuance.

As -ye verbs are always transitive, they do not have intransitive participle forms. All other intransitive participles are formed with the ending -ubi.

| Verb | -ye | -we | -re | -le |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Ending | **-N/A-** | -ubi | -rubi | -lubi |

## Coordinates

Coordinates are a special non-finite verb form used for joining multiple verbs within the same clause. Verbs used as coordinates must agree in transivity and tense to the final conjugated verb. Under a tripartite verb system, this means that clauses in English containing both transitive and intransitive verbs are significantly less efficient, and must instead split up the sentence into multiple clauses, with one for the intransitive verbs and one for the transitive ones.

### Sequential coordinate

The sequential coordinate is used for listing events in a particular order, and may be an exhaustive list or simply illustrative. 

| Sequential | -ye | -we | -re | -le |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Past | -yen | -wen | -ren | -len |
| Present | -yek | -wek | -rek | -lek |
| Future | -yeba | -weba | -reba | -leba |

### Exhaustive coordinate

The exhaustive coordinate is used for listing a clear and complete set of actions without putting them in a particular order.

| Non-sequential
exhaustive | -ye | -we | -re | -le |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Past | -yeten | -weten | -reten | -leten |
| Present | -yete | -wete | -rete | -lete |
| Future | -yeteba | -weteba | -reteba | -leteba |

### Illustrative coordinate

The illustrative coordinate is used for listing examples of actions without putting them in a particular order.

| Non-sequential
illustrative | -ye | -we | -re | -le |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Past | -yegan | -wegan | -regan | -legan |
| Present | -yega | -wega | -rega | -lega |
| Future | -yegaba | -wegaba | -regaba | -legaba |
