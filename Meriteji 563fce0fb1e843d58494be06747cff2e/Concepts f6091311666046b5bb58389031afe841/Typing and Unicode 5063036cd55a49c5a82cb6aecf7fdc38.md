# Typing and Unicode

Due to varying technical restraints, Meriteji can be encoded digitally in multiple ways. These formats are described below, from most- to least- compatible.

# US/ASCII-Compatible Alphabet

This format loosely follows the non-diacritical romanization display format; however it uses the base characters of blotsekya. In exchange for authentic syllable structuring, the number of code points is greatly reduced and can be typed with merely an English-US keyboard and font support.

Advantages:

- English-US keyboard compatible

Disadvantages:

- Inauthentic linear alphabet
