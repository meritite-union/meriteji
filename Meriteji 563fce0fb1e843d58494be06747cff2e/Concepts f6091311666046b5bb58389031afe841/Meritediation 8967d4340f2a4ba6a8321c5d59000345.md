# Meritediation

This is a guide to converting foreign words (names, loan words, etc.) to be writable in Meritji. There are various degrees to this, and multiple options to take. A word may be written as closely as possible to the original word, retaining all information, or it may be shortened and simplified to be more easily pronouncable. 

Here is an incomplete guide:

## Onsets and Glides

English consonants as onsets p, t, k, b, d, g, s, z, ch, j, m, n, and h are retained, even if they are realized as /ɾ/. f becomes p, and v becomes b. sh becomes *sy*, and zh becomes *zy*. Unvoiced /th/ becomes *s*, and voiced /th/ becomes *d*. w, r, y, and l are also included as-is. Only the consonant-glide clusters described here may be combined within one syllable.

|  | /j/ | /w/ | /r/ | /l/ |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| /p/ | Y | Y | Y | Y |
| /t/ | Y, →/tʃ/ | N | S³ | S³ |
| /k/ | Y | Y | Y | Y |
| /b/ | Y | Y | Y | Y |
| /d/ | Y, -> /dʒ/ | N | S³ | S³ |
| /g/ | Y | Y | Y | Y |
| /m/ | Y | Y | N | N |
| /n/ | Y | Y | N | N |
| /ŋ/ | Y | Y | N | N |
| /h/ | Y | Y | N | N |
| /s/ | Y, -> /ʃ/ | Y | N | N |
| /z/ | Y, -> /ʒ/ | Y | N | N |
| /t̠ʃ/ | N | N | N | N |
| /d̠ʒ/ | N | N | N | N |
| Ø | Y | Y | Y | Y |

Clusters labeled as ‘S’ above may be used as one cluster, but to become fully nativized they must be split.

## Vowels

/ɑː/, /ɒ/, /æ/ become *a*

/ai/ becomes *ai*

/aʊ/, /ɔː/ become *au*

/ɛ/, /e/ become *e*

/eɪ/ becomes *ei*

/ɔɪ/ becomes o.i

/ɪ/, /i/ become *i*

/iː/ (and final /i/) becomes *ï*

/ʊ/, /uː/ /u/ become *u*

/ʌ/, /ə/ become *a*

/oʊ/ becomes *o*

/ɑːr/, /ɒr/, /ær/, /ʌr/, /ər/ become *ä*

/ɜr/ becomes *ë*

## Codas and Other Things

The conversion of syllable final consonants (codas) is more sensitive to local specifics. As above, meritediation can follow a strict or loose conversion model, but this is more apparent for coda conversion. For example, the nasal coda ‘~’ follows an assimilation pattern. In a strict model, the conversion can follow this assimilation pattern, and if it does not match, the coda must be syllabified. In a loose model, this change would be accepted and ignored. This is also the case for the other codas. There is more room for interpretation here. It is up to the converter to choose whether final /r/ should accept the *l* coda, whether this applies to /r/, /ɾ/, andor /ɹ/. The same decision must be made for *s* and *k*. This page continues with examples to help clarify this, and all above, statements.
