2. Where present, /r/ and /ɾ/ are in free variation, where /r/ can be emphatic.
3. Meriteji has a rhotic dialect. In such dialects, /r/, /ɾ/, and coda /l/ are realized as /ɹ/

## Vowels

|  | Front | Central | Back |

| Close | i ḭ |  | ɯ~u ṵ |
| Mid | e~ɛ ḛ |  | ɤ~o |

<aside>
<img src="https://www.notion.so/icons/asterisk_lightgray.svg" alt="https://www.notion.so/icons/asterisk_lightgray.svg" width="40px" /> All vowel variations are in free variation, with unspecified differences in dialect.

Diphthongs include /ei/, /ai/, and /ɑu/. /o/ is treated as a dipthong for historic reasons (was pronounced /eu/).

## Phonotactics

> **(C1)(G)V(C2).**
> 

C1 includes /p/ /b/ /t/ /d/ /k/ /g/ /m/ /n/ /ŋ/ /h/ /x/ /s/ /z/ /ʃ/ /ʒ/ /t̠ʃ/ /d̠ʒ/

G includes /j/ /w/ /r/ /l/

V includes all vowels.

C2 includes /m/ /n/ /ŋ/ /s/ /l/ /t/ /k’/

Nasal coda assimilates to /m/ /n/ /ŋ/ based on location of following consonant; /n/ if none

Stop coda is /k’/ at the end of an utterance/morpheme, /t/ elsewhere

Double coda/onsets with matching phonemes break natural [morphology](Morphology%20f88b51f7c8bb479884e4b9e744289862.md), except for the nasal ~, where it is not pronounced. Under the same morphology rules, a coda cannot be followed by a null consonant.

3. Only possible within non-nativized loanwords. Often pronounced as two syllables.

## Coda to next syllable

The four codas are greatly allophonic: they very frequently assimilate to the following onset. There are various rules for what combinations are possible, what they result in, and how to romanize such combinations.

### Nasal coda

The nasal coda assimilates based on the following rules:
