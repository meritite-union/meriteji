# Adjectives

Take a placeholder noun when in a predicate position.  In Noun Adjectives with a different genitive meaning than nominative, a placeholder noun can be used.

## Jentie (Genitive Adjective)

Jentie are derived from nouns in their genitive forms. They have an implication of being categorical; there is a feeling of “one of the”. Being essentially special genitive nouns, they do not inflect to match the noun they describe. Many Jentie have different meanings from their standard noun counterparts, and others’ noun forms have become obsolete. To distinguish from the noun, two (optional) changes must be made. When the word directly precedes the noun, [le](Dictionary%2023de6f42cf0a4897a538a2e01f8f7ef9/le%20ba26af5454eb4ac8ab821f9fa3ebbb51.md) **(to be) can be attatched with the Jentie in its noun form, or in its genitive form with a placeholder noun. In predicate form, the noun the Jentie is derived from can be used, or a placeholder noun can be used. To convert Jentie to an adverb, add -*li*.

## Atnate (Agreement Adjective)

Atnate are their own class of adjectives. Most do not derive from other words; words derive from them. All base, dictionary form atnate end in -*i*. Atnate adjectives inflect to agree with the noun that they describe. There are two patterns, based on whether the noun is (D1, D3, D4, or D5) or D2. Inflection tables are shown below:

| D1, D3, D4, D5 | -i |
| --- | --- |
| Nominative | -yo |
| Accusative | -ya |
| Genitive | -ye |
| Particular | -i |
| Vocative | -yai |
| Intransitive | -yu |

| D2 | -i |
| --- | --- |
| Nominative | -i |
| Accusative | -in |
| Genitive | -is |
| Particular | -il |
| Vocative | -ik |
| Intransitive | -i |

Atnate adjectives can **never** be bare, as they cannot behave as nouns when needed. As such, in the predicate, a placeholder noun must be used. To form an adverb, change the ending to -*ili*.
