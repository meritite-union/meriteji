# Nouns and Declension

Nouns in Meriteji have no gender or plurality. Historically, there was a paucal and plural suffix system, however this only survives in pronouns today. Nouns do, however, decline under 6 cases, changing the end of a noun based on its position and purpose in a sentence. The cases (explained below) are as follows, and in this order: 

> **Nominative** (*NOM*), **Accusative** (*ACC*), **Genitive** (*GEN*), **Particular** (*PRT*), **Vocative** (*VOC*), and **Intransitive** (*INT*).
> 

An important concept to Meriteji its its detatchment of the intransitive subject from the familiar nominative-accusative system’s transitive agent, or in even more fancy linguistic words, tripartite alignment.

- Transivity & Tripartite Alignment Explanation
    
    Consider these English sentences:
    
    **I** dropped **the ball**.
    
    **The ball** fell.
    
    In the first sentence, the verb “to drop” is transitive, meaning the subject of the sentence, **I**, is acting onto something else, the direct object, **the ball.** In the second sentence, there is no action being performed to another. This is not necessarily reflexive, as the ball may have started to fall as a result of something else. It is also not passive, although it is somewhat implied. In Meriteji, this second case is treated seperately from the first one, as if **I** in the first example and **the ball** are nothing alike.
    

The Nominative case is the actor or agent of a transitive verb. It must be paired, at least implied, with something in the Accusative case, which is the recipient, patient, direct object, etc. of a transitive verb. The Genitive case is used to show possesion, attribution, or noun phrase apposition. The Particular case (may be more familiar if incorrectly described as the Prepositional case) is used in tandem with Meriteji’s various postpositions, commonly called particles in this grammar system. In absence of a particle, the particular case functions as a daitive case, acting as an indirect object. The Vocative case is a rare and special case whose exclusive purpose is to describe the addressee of a sentence, i.e. who the speaker is talking to. Finally, the Intransitive case. This case is relatively unique to Meriteji, and it has unique properties of its own. It is used for the subjects of intransitive verbs, as described above. It can also be used for reflexive, transitive verbs, for when the subject and object are the same, for the subject and predicate on both sides of the verb *le* (to be), and for reciprocal (”each other”) constructions.

# Declining Nouns

Nouns are presented in their **absolute** (linguistic term) or **dictionary** (what I call it) form, as described, in dictionaries, or when talking about a word as a word, or when saying a word out of context or independently. From this state, different categories of nouns take different methods of becoming declined to the proper case. All nouns have a defined class, listed alongside dictionary definitions, and learning them is essential. There are 5, and only 5, D1, D2, D3, D4, and D5. Their systems are explained below.

### D1 (Vowel Stem) Nouns

<aside>
<img src="https://www.notion.so/icons/info-alternate_green.svg" alt="https://www.notion.so/icons/info-alternate_green.svg" width="40px" /> …are the most common category. In this category, the final vowel of a word changes to match the case. Any codas will remain following the changed vowel.

</aside>

- Nominative: Vowel becomes [o].
- Accusative: Vowel becomes [a].
- Genitive: Vowel becomes [e].
- Particular: Vowel becomes [i].
- Vocative: Vowel becomes [ai].
- Intransitive: Dictionary form.

### **D2 Nouns (Coda Stem)**

<aside>
<img src="https://www.notion.so/icons/info-alternate_green.svg" alt="https://www.notion.so/icons/info-alternate_green.svg" width="40px" /> …occur only in words that end with open vowels (no coda). They decline by adding different codas to the end.

</aside>

- Nominative: No change from the dictionary form (implied case marking)
- Accusative: [n] is added.
- Genitive: [s] is added.
- Particular: [l] is added.
- Vocative: [k] is added.
- Intransitive: Dictionary form.

### **D3 Nouns (Creaky Stem)**

<aside>
<img src="https://www.notion.so/icons/info-alternate_green.svg" alt="https://www.notion.so/icons/info-alternate_green.svg" width="40px" /> Most nouns that end with a creaky vowel (and potentially a coda) are D3. The final vowel changes like D1, and the coda is similarly kept.

</aside>

- Nominative: Vowel becomes [ë].
- Accusative: Vowel becomes [ä].
- Genitive: Vowel becomes [ë].
- Particular: Vowel becomes [ï].
- Vocative: Vowel becomes [ä].
- Intransitive: Dictionary form.

### **D4 Nouns (N-Stem)**

<aside>
<img src="https://www.notion.so/icons/info-alternate_green.svg" alt="https://www.notion.so/icons/info-alternate_green.svg" width="40px" /> These nouns decline by adding an extra syllable. They often, but do not need to, end in -n coda.

</aside>

- Nominative: [no] is added.
- Accusative: [na] is added.
- Genitive: [ne] is added.
- Particular: [ni] is added.
- Vocative: [nai] is added.
- Intransitive: Dictionary form.

### **D5 Nouns** **(Bucket Stem)**

<aside>
<img src="https://www.notion.so/icons/info-alternate_green.svg" alt="https://www.notion.so/icons/info-alternate_green.svg" width="40px" /> This is a catch all for all nouns, including proper and non-nativized loan words. It is clunky, but always works. It is sometimes omitted when the case is very obvious through context. It works by adding syllables. May be done anyway purely for clarification. Non D5 nouns can also decline under D5 for extra emphasis, or equally for cluelessness.

</aside>

- Nominative: [gon] is added.
- Accusative: [gan] is added.
- Genitive: [gen] is added.
- Particular: [gin] is added.
- Vocative: [gain] is added.
- Intransitive: [gun] is added.

## Patterns

Although not as simple as a basic suffix deciding what declension to follow, there are some predicting patterns that are not very cleanly based on "feeling," as certain patterns are more likely to occur and some combinations are perceived as cleaner. This causes certain principles to lead to general patterns.

### Limited long vowels

In general, words are unlikely to gain extra long vowels if the base form already contains more than one in the stem. No nativized word contains two creaky vowels in the same root. This means that nouns with creaky vowels tend to be D2 or D4, to avoid adding the long o. This is also, to a lesser extent, true for diphthongs. If a stem ends in -on, it is very likely that it is D4.

All D3 nouns have a creaky vowel in their stem's final syllable, and almost all nouns with a creaky vowel in their stem's final syllable are D3.

### Hard rules involving codas

If a stem (lemma form) has a coda, no declension will change that. 

**Rules organized by likelihood**

Stem ends in a creaky vowel → D3
