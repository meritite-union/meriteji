# Morphology

In the forming of new words, issues arise between the boundaries between words. 

The coda consonants in particular cause trouble when compounding words or affixes. This provides a clear distinction between a fully formed, official “word” and simply combining terms together. To solidify a word, any coda-onset combinations that would not appear through natural morpheme generation must be moved.

The tl, tr, dl, and dr consonant clusters are acceptable in loan words, in the same way, words do not natively appear with a creaky vowel + coda—still pronounceable and valid.
